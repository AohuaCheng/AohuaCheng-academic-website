title: Multi-modality ANN’s model of flexible working memory

summary: Inspired by ANN recent achievements of multi-task training in neuroscience, this project is building a systematic NN
model to understand the flexibility of Working Memory (WM). Different from previous work on WM, our model can
conduct delay-match or N-back tasks from a few modalities, like vison, auditory, text, etc.
