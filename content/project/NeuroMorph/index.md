Neural morphological development is a daunting problem in biology and interests physicians and computer scientists for its intriguing physics mechanisms and potential applications in neuromorphic architecture designs. Here we present an semi-analytical framework to formalize key biophysical processes underlying single neuron and neural cluster morphological development, such as the coupled reaction-diffusion of tubulin, calcium, and MAP-2 and the molecular guidance of axons. An efficient computational implementation of this framework, Asuka, is proposed to reproduce critical development steps, such as synapse growing, competing, branching, path finding, and connecting. The high-resolution, large-scale, and long-term neural morphological dynamics computed by this system is consistent with in-vivo and in-vitro experimental observations. Then, we have applied Asuka on the largest brain connectome of the fruit fly (∼2.5 ×104 neurons) to model whole brain development in weeks. Furthermore, we have designed a technique to make Asuka couple with the training framework (e.g., PyTorch) of artificial neural networks (ANNs), regulating neural morphological development by learning tasks and training ANNs according to biophysical mechanisms. These works demonstrate our theory and Asuka as promising foundations towards the unified understanding of neural morphological development mechanisms and their applications in neuromorphic computation and learning.
