abstract: "The invention belongs to the technical field of medical robots, and particularly relates to a trachea cannula robot for simulating doctor operation. The endotracheal intubation robot includes an executive, vision and control system. The execution system includes: the robot and a moving chassis thereof, an interface bracket, mechanical arms at two sides, a rotatable joint, a mechanical claw and the like. The vision system includes: depth cameras, multifunction laryngoscopes, and the like. The control system includes: the robot comprises a force sensor, a robot control box, a background computer, a communication system and the like. The invention realizes automatic and remote control intubation operation based on a robot system, and uses visual and force information for autonomous intubation control. The robot successfully solves the contradiction between rescue and protection when medical care personnel perform intubation treatment, simulates the operation of doctors, has the advantages of unique design, simple structure, convenient and safe use, long service life and the like, is suitable for the endotracheal intubation of the robot, and can be popularized and applied in a large scale."
