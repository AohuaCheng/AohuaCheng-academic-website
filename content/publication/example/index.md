title: Autonomous Intubation Robot System based on Visual Servoing and Hybrid Control
abstract: During COVID-19 and other pandemics, endotracheal intubation is an
  effective and common method to save patients as the virus causes lung fibrosis
  and thus patients are unable to breathe spontaneously. Medical staff need to
  insert a tube close to the patient’s mouth, thereby leading to a high risk of
  cross-infection. To protect medical staff, we propose an autonomous intubation
  robot system (AIRS). With the developed visual servoing and hybrid control
  method, the entire system can simulate doctors for satisfying repeatability
  and safety of intubation operations. This system includes a
  self-driving/teleoperation platform, two co-robot arms, a new multi-functional
  laryngoscope, force sensors, and several cameras. In the visual servoing part,
  we realize recognition and location of the patient’s face, medical devices,
  and main physiological structures to provide real-time navigation. In the
  hybrid control part, we establish an oral model, propose an offline planning
  method and PID controllers by combining force, vision, and motion, and apply
  Virtual Fixture to insert safely. AIRS's validation is with a phantom model
  under a 2-min operation. Our proposed robot is original and promising in the
  area of emergent medical robots. We will further validate AIRS in clinical
  applications and extend the developed techniques in other general treatments.
