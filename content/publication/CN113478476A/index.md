abstract: "The invention belongs to the technical field of robot control, and particularly relates to a method for planning a path of a mechanical arm. The planning method of the mechanical arm path provided by the invention enables the mechanical arm to move in a relatively optimal mode. The main process is to construct a value function of a path, randomly generate the path, optimize the path by using a nonlinear optimization method, solve an extreme value, select the optimal path in each group and input the optimal path into the mechanical arm. The path planning method of the invention ensures that the mechanical arm movement of the robot has the advantages of short movement distance, long distance from the non-working area, small maximum speed and acceleration and the like, the path planning of the mechanical arm is reasonable and reliable, and the efficiency and the safety of the robot for completing tasks are improved."
